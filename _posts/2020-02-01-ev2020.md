---

I had the opportunity to work with [Sherrie Wang](http://stanford.edu/~sherwang/) and [Prof. David Lobell](https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/people/david_lobell) in a three month research stay. It was funded by the [DAAD-IFI](https://www.daad.de/de/im-ausland-studieren-forschen-lehren/forschen-im-ausland/ifi/) program and the [TUM Graduate school](https://www.gs.tum.de/gs/betreuende/internationalisierung/).

Our paper [Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Land Cover Classification](http://www.classic.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2020/july_stuff/webpage/papers/Russwurm_Meta-Learning_for_Few-Shot_Land_Cover_Classification_CVPRW_2020_paper.pdf) received the best paper award at the 2020 [Earthvision workshop](http://www.classic.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2020/) at CVPR 2020.
