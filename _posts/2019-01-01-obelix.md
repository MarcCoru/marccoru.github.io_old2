---

I had the pleasure to work with [Prof. Tavenar], [Lefevre](http://people.irisa.fr/Sebastien.Lefevre/), [Courty](https://people.irisa.fr/Nicolas.Courty/), on Early Classification of Time Series (ELECTS) in a research stay at the [Obelix Lab](http://www.irisa.fr/en/teams/obelix) in Vannes, France.
Our [arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10283) and [source code](https://github.com/marccoru/elects) is published.
