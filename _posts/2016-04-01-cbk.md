title: Erasmus Internship at Warsaw Earth Observation Group.
---

I did a [Erasmus+](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en) internship at the [Earth Observation Group](https://www.cbk.waw.pl/en/) in Warsaw. I experienced with algorithms for opium field detection with data from multiple dates acquired by multiple satellites. This internship was the thematic start in the topic of crop type mapping and time series classification.
