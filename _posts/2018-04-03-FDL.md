I participated at the [Frontier Development Lab](https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/) in 2018. We worked on a multi-sensor datafusion convolutional neural network for flood detection which was [published at AAAI 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01756) with [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/FrontierDevelopmentLab/multi3net)
